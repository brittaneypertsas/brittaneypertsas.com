  <p style="color:black;"> 	Brittaney Pertsas is an up-and-coming French Horn player in the Baltimore area. She first broke out into the orchestral scene at the Aspen Music Festival in 2018 and 2019 as a fellow. Since then, her highlights include her Carnegie Hall debut with the New York String Orchestra Seminar under the direction of Jamie Laredo in 2019,  playing ‘Shostakovich 7’ ‘Enigma Variations’ and ‘Mahler 2’ with her teacher John Zirbel in the Aspen Festival Orchestra, and most recently playing Principal Horn on ‘Ein Helenleben’ with conductor Gerard Schwarz in February 2020.
Pertsas has performed at the Orford Wind Octet Seminar under the tutelage of members of the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal and Boston Symphony. She has also performed at the Banff Chamber Music intensive with the Imani Winds, JACK Quartet, and the International Contemporary Ensemble. Her most recent chamber music venture is the Rose Artemisia Piano Sextet. Formed in 2019, they gave performances in the Greater Miami area. They were most recently named fellows of the Banff Chamber Music and Cortona New Music sessions where they would premiere a new work by Dr. Charles Mason; due to COVID their performance plans have been postponed.
Pertsas has played in masterclasses for horn players such as Erik Ralske, Tim Jones, Stefan Dohr, and Andrew Bain. She is currently pursuing her master’s degree under the tutelage of Robert Rearden. Her personal hobbies include cooking, filmmaking, and reading. Her career goal is to play in an opera house, and one day perform  the entire ‘Ring Cycle’.
